## Queue

A **Queue** is a linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) manner. That is, the first element in the queue is the first to be removed. 

The queue data structure can be built using arrays/lists or linked lists.

A good real life example of queues is printer queue. The first document in the queue is the first to be printed.

### Queue Implementation
- Python Lists: Queue without capacity and Circular queue (queue with capacity)
- Linked Lists

### Common Queue Operations
- **Create Queue**: create the queue.
- **Enqueue**: insert an element to the queue.
- **Dequeue**: remove the top element of the queue.
- **Peek**: returns the first element of the queue without removing it.
- **Is Empty**: to check if the queue is empty.
- **Is Full**: to check if the queue has reached its max capacity.
- **Delete Queue**: to clear the queue or delete all the element in the queue.
