## Stack

A **Stack** is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) manner. That is, the last element in the stack is the first to be removed, and the first will be the last to be removed. 

The stack data structure can be built using arrays/lists or linked lists.

A good real life implementation of stacks is web pages in web browsers (the back button). The last inserted page is the first to be popped.

### Common Stack Operations
- **Push**: add a new element to the stack.
- **Pop**: remove the last inserted element in the stack.
- **Peek**: returning the last inserted element in the stack without removing it.
- **Is Empty**: to check if the stack is empty.
- **Size**: to return the number of elements in the stack.
- **Delete All**: to clear the stack or delete all the element in the stack.
