## Tree Data Structure 

A tree is a non-linear data structure that represents hierarchical relationships between elements and contains no cycles. A common real-life example is a family tree.

#### Properties:
- Represent hierarchical data.
- Each node contains data and references (links) to its child nodes.
- It consists of a root node and subtrees of children nodes.

**Root:** The top node with no parent.
**Edge:** The connection between a parent and child node.
**Leaf:** A node with no children.
**Siblings:** Nodes that share the same parent.
**Ancestor:** A parent, grandparent, or any predecessor of a node.
**Depth of Node:** The number of edges from the root to that node.
**Height of Tree:** The maximum number of edges from the root to any leaf.
